# Introduction to Browser API

> Learn how Bright Data's Browser API simplifies multi-step data collection with robust proxy networks, browser automation, and full unblocking capabilities.

Browser API is part of our [unlocker scraping suite](/scraping-automation/introduction) and is designed to simplify your **multi-step data collection** from browsers.

Your scraping code runs seamlessly on our dedicated browsers, leveraging multiple proxy networks (including residential IPs) and managing the full unblocking of every page including custom headers, fingerprinting, CAPTCHA solving, and more.

Effortlessly access and navigate your target websites via standard browsing libraries like `puppeteer`, `playwright`, and `selenium` (see our [full list here](https://docs.brightdata.com/scraping-automation/scraping-browser/faqs#which-programming-languages-libraries-and-browser-automation-tools-are-supported-by-browser-api)), to extract the precise data you need at unlimited **scale** and unlimited **concurrent sessions.**

### Best for

* Seamlessly navigating websites, filling out forms, clicking buttons, scrolling to load full pages, hovering, solving CAPTCHAs, and more interactive actions
* `Puppeteer`, `playwright`, and `selenium` integration with the flexibility to scale the number of active browser sessions up or down as needed.
* Teams without a reliable, scalable in-house browser unblocking infrastructure
