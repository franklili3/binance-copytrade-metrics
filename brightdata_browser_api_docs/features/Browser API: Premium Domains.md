# Browser API: Premium Domains

> Premium domains are a part of Bright Data's tiered website classification system. These are websites that are more challenging to unblock than others and require additional Browser API resources.

### Enable Premium Domains

When creating your Browser API zone, enable the 'Premium Domains' switch.

### Pricing

Once enabled, the premium price will be reflected in the "Estimated cost" section.

<Note>
  Even after enabled, only specific requests to these domains will be priced at the higher rate. Requests to other domains will be kept at the default lower tier.
